## Interview Problems

3-18. [3] What method would you use to look up a word in a dictionary?
Binary Search (sorted)
RunTime:
Best Case: O(1)
Worst Case: log(N)
Big O: log(N)

3-19. [3] Imagine you have a closet full of shirts. What can you do to organize your shirts
for easy retrieval?
Organize by size, type, color?

3-20. [4] Write a function to find the middle node of a singly-linked list.
Pseudocode: Would keep a counter to find length of the list, then iterate again to go to the middle... O(N)

3-21. [4] Write a function to compare whether two binary trees are identical. Identical
trees have the same key value at each position and the same structure.
Psedocode:

3-22. [4] Write a program to convert a binary search tree into a linked list.
3-23. [4] Implement an algorithm to reverse a linked list. Now do it without recursion.
3-24. [5] What is the best data structure for maintaining URLs that have been visited by
a Web crawler? Give an algorithm to test whether a given URL has already been
visited, optimizing both space and time.
3-25. [4] You are given a search string and a magazine. You seek to generate all the characters
in search string by cutting them out from the magazine. Give an algorithm
to efficiently determine whether the magazine contains all the letters in the search
string.

3. DATA STRUCTURES
   3-26. [4] Reverse the words in a sentence—i.e., “My name is Chris” becomes “Chris is
   name My.” Optimize for time and space.
   3-27. [5] Determine whether a linked list contains a loop as quickly as possible without
   using any extra storage. Also, identify the location of the loop.
   3-28. [5] You have an unordered array X of n integers. Find the array M containing
   n elements where Mi is the product of all integers in X except for Xi. You may
   not use division. You can use extra memory. (Hint: There are solutions faster than
   O(n2).)
   3-29. [6] Give an algorithm for finding an ordered word pair (e.g., “New York”) occurring
   with the greatest frequency in a given webpage. Which data structures would you
   use? Optimize both time and space
